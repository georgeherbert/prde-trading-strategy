By means of an extensivetestbed it is demonstrated that the new methodconverges faster and with more certainty than manyother acclaimed global optimization methods. The newmethod requires few control variables, is robust, easyto use, and lends itself very well to parallelcomputation.},

  abstract  = {We report market experiments in which human traders are replaced by "zero-intelligence" programs that submit random bids and offers. Imposing a budget constraint (i.e., not permitting traders to sell below their costs or buy above their values) is sufficient to raise the allocative efficiency of these auctions close to 100 percent. Allocative efficiency of a double auction derives largely from its structure, independent of traders' motivation, intelligence, or learning. Adam Smith's invisible hand may be more powerful than some may have thought; it can generate aggregate rationality not only from individual rationality but also from individual irrationality.},

  abstract  = {The Continuous Double Auction (CDA) is the dominant market institution for real-world trading of equities, commodities, derivatives, etc. We describe a series of laboratory experiments that, for the first time, allow human subjects to interact with software bidding agents in a CDA. Our bidding agents use strategies based on extensions of the Gjerstad-Dickhaut and Zero-Intelligence-Plus algorithms. We find that agents consistently obtain significantly larger gains from trade than their human counterparts. This was unexpected because both humans and agents have approached theoretically perfect efficiency in prior all-human or all-agent CDA experiments. Another unexpected finding is persistent far-from-equilibrium trading, in sharp contrast to the robust convergence observed in previous all-human or all-agent experiments. We consider possible explanations for our empirical findings, and speculate on the implications for future agent-human interactions in electronic markets.},
